# Tic-Toc-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple, two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. One player uses the symbol "X" and the other uses the symbol "O". Players take turns marking an empty cell in the grid with their respective symbols.

Objective:
The goal of the game is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either:

Horizontally (across any row),
Vertically (down any column), or
Diagonally (either direction).
Rules:
The game starts with an empty grid, and players decide who goes first.
Players alternate turns, placing their symbol (either X or O) in an empty cell.
The game continues until one player successfully aligns three of their symbols or the grid is completely filled (resulting in a tie if no one wins).
